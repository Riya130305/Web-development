            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.

            HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.
            It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.

            In a nutshell, HTML is all about organizing and displaying information on a webpage. We can think of it as the bones or structure of a webpage.
